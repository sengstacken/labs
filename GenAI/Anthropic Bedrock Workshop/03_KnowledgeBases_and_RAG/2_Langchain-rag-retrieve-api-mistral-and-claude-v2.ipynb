    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will dive deep into building Q&A application using Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock - Retrieve API. Here, we will query the knowledge base to get the desired number of document chunks based on similarity search. We will then augment the prompt with relevant documents and query which will go as input to Anthropic Claude V2 for generating response.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a knowledge base, you can securely connect foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock to your company\n",
    "data for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Access to additional data helps the model generate more relevant,\n",
    "context-speciﬁc, and accurate responses without continuously retraining the FM. All information retrieved from\n",
    "knowledge bases comes with source attribution to improve transparency and minimize hallucinations. For more information on creating a knowledge base using console, please refer to this [post](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html).\n",
    "We will cover 2 parts in the notebook:\n",
    "- Part 1, we will share how you can use `RetrieveAPI` with foundation models from Amazon Bedrock. We will use the `mistral.mistral-7b` model. \n",
    "- Part 2, we will showcase the langchain integration using Anthropic Claude V2.1 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the solution using Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. RAG retrieves data from outside the language model (non-parametric) and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. Here, we are performing RAG effectively on the knowledge base created using console/sdk. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisite\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and ingested in vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the documents into the knowledge base by connecting your s3 bucket (data source). \n",
    "2. Ingestion - Knowledge bases will split them into smaller chunks (based on the strategy selected), generate embeddings and store it in the associated vectore store and notebook [0_create_ingest_documents_test_kb.ipynb](./0\\_create_ingest_documents_test_kb.ipynb) takes care of it for you.\n",

    "#### Notebook Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our notebook we will use the `Retreive API` provided by Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock which converts user queries into\n",
    "embeddings, searches the knowledge base, and returns the relevant results, giving you more control to build custom\n",
    "workﬂows on top of the semantic search results. The output of the `Retrieve API` includes the the `retrieved text chunks`, the `location type` and `URI` of the source data, as well as the relevance `scores` of the retrievals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use the text chunks being generated and augment it with the original prompt and pass it through the `anthropic.claude-v2` model using prompt engineering patterns based on your use case.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### USE CASE:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use several years of Amazon's Letter to Shareholders as a text corpus to perform Q&A on. This data is already ingested into the Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock. You will need the `knowledge base id` to run this example.\n",
    "In your specific use case, you can sync different files for different domain topics and query this notebook in the same manner to evaluate model responses using the retrieve API from knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Python 3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠  For this lab we need to run the notebook based on a Python 3.10 runtime. ⚠\n",
    "\n",
    "If you carry out the workshop from your local environment outside of the Amazon SageMaker studio please make sure you are running a Python runtime > 3.10.\n",

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.   We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.   Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.   So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy- five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.   AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings.', metadata={'location': {'type': 'S3', 's3Location': {'uri': 's3://bedrock-kb-us-west-2-061516707533/AMZN-2020-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'}}, 'score': 0.62816936}),\n",

These are astounding numbers. We realized the equivalent of three years’ forecasted growth in about 15 months.   As the world opened up again starting in late Q2 2021, and more people ventured out to eat, shop, and travel, consumer spending returned to being spread over many more entities. We weren’t sure what to expect in 2021, but the fact that we continued to grow at double digit rates (with a two-year Consumer compounded annual growth rate of 29%) was encouraging as customers appreciated the role Amazon played for them during the pandemic, and started using Amazon for a larger amount of their household purchases.   This growth also created short-term logistics and cost challenges. We spent Amazon’s first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand. As we were bringing this new capacity online, the labor market tightened considerably, making it challenging both to receive all of the inventory our vendors and sellers wanted to send us and to place that inventory as close to customers as we typically do. Combined with ocean, air, and trucking capacity becoming scarcer and more expensive, this created extra transportation and productivity costs. Supply chains were disrupted in ways none of us had seen previously. We hoped that the major impact from COVID-19 would recede as 2021 drew to a close, but then omicron reared its head in December, which had worldwide ramifications, including impacting people’s ability to work.

    "Retrieve API provides you with the flexibility of using any foundation model provided by Amazon Bedrock, and choosing the right search type, either HYBRID or SEMANTIC, based on your use case. \n",
    "Here is the [blog](#https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock-now-supports-hybrid-search/) for Hybrid Search feature, for more details."
